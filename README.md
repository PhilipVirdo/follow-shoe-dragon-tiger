Follow the Shoe Simulator for Dragon Tiger Game 

Hello, this is my first program uploaded to GitHub!
This program runs a simulation of the Dragon Tiger casino game using the Follow the Shoe method, meaning the program will always place its bets on the previous winner. The parameters for the number of hands being dealt, the size of your starting bankroll size, and size of the player's bets can all be changed to whatever you like. By default, the simulation will start with a bankroll of $100, wager $1 per hand, and deal 100000 times. Then the following results will be printed to the console: total dragon wins, total tiger wins, and the final balance.

I hope you enjoy and if you have any feedback please share!

Thanks!
